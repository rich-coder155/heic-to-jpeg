# Heic Image File Conversion

This is a collection of scripts and tools to aid with the conversion of one of the latest image file formats (heic) to a more universally accessible format such has jpeg.

This came into being as a result of some charity work I was doing where a group of us were collaborating together in online merchandising. Some users were using different mobile phones that support the new format and I wanted a quick and easy way to bring these together into a more universal format, that worked with our external web platforms consistently. I have heard friends and family report the same issue at their small businesses when collaborating with e.g. engineers, auditors etc.

### About the Code
- A simple script (Python initially) to do the conversion easily
- Easy to add to automation workflows when dealing with images from different sources
- A stepping stone to building a more user friendly tool if required, for all users

### Portfolio And Repository Goals
- Their maybe additions that move away from the initial Python version to showcase my software writing skills in general
-- Whatever gets the job done
-- In the easiest way possible for all
-- That showcases my skills
