# Heic Image File Conversion

This is a collection of scripts and tools to aid with the conversion of one of the latest image file formats (heic) to a more universally accessible format such as jpeg.

The need arose for me whilst carrying out some charity work,
where a group of us were collaborating in online merchandising.
Some users were using different mobile phones that support the new format and I wanted an easy way to bring these together into a more universally accessible format,
that worked with our external web platforms consistently (not all support this format either).

I have heard of this issue mentioned before, from other workplaces where e.g. engineers, auditors etc, email photos back to the office that can't be viewed.

### About the Code
- A simple script (Python initially) to do the conversion easily
- Easy to add to automation workflows when dealing with images from different sources
- A stepping stone to building a more user friendly tool if required, for all users

### Portfolio and Repository Goals
Their maybe additions that move away from the initial Python version to showcase my software writing skills in general.
- Whatever gets the job done
- In the easiest way possible for all
- That showcases my skills
